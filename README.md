In this project, we've explored three different authentication mechanisms that can be used to secure a REST API:<br><br><br>
1) Authenticating Requests to a Spring Data REST API with HTTP Basic(In this module, we've create a REST API that authenticates with a username and password against a database.)<br><br>
2) Authenticating and Authorizing Requests with JWT(In this module, we've add JWT-based Bearer Token Authentication as a more secure alternative to HTTP Basic.)<br><br>
3) Authenticating and Authorizing Requests with Opaque Token(In this module, we've change JWTs out for Opaque Tokens for additional security.)
